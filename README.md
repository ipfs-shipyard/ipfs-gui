## Goal

Make the IPFS GUIs simple, accessible, reusable and beautiful.

- **Simple** - Fight complexity at every step. There are big ideas in IPFS. Let's present them clearly.
- **Accessible** - IPFS **must** be usable and comprehensible for everyone.
- **Reusable** - Publish and promote this work. Make doing the right thing the easiest thing.
- **Beautiful** - Demonstrate the nature of the system with effortless, coherent, and compelling interfaces.

## IPFS GUI Projects

- [IPFS Web UI] - Graphical IPFS file manager and network explorer.
- [IPFS Desktop] -  Launch and manage IPFS from your OS GUI.
- [IPFS Companion] - Give your browser IPFS super powers.
- [IPFS CSS] - Single-purpose css rules and font-face config to IPFS up your UI.

## Status

We are focused on rebuilding and shipping the new [IPFS Web UI].

Once that is shipped we will be extracting what we have learned into a UI guidebook and a reusable component library. Then we'll be using those components to develop the next iteration of [IPFS Desktop] and [IPFS Companion].

![Roadmap](./ROADMAP.png)

## Process

- [Research and document](research/README.md) the existing IPFS apps: IPFS Web UI, Desktop & Companion.
- Create a [list of existing features](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-ipfs-gui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22existing+feature%22) and define the ideal way to offer up each concept to the users.
- Define the [purpose and scope of each app](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-ipfs-gui/issues/41).
- Document the implementation roadmap (see below)
- Create [wireframes](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/13924274) for new apps
- [Build them!](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui/tree/revamp)

We want to make IPFS GUIs simple, accessible, reusable and beautiful. To do this, we’ll gather together a list of the features that appear in Desktop, Companion and WebUI, compare their implementations, and find consensus on the ideal way to offer up each concept to the users.

With that list agreed, we’ll then **define the purpose and scope of each app**, and how it’s feature set integrates with the other apps. We don’t want each app to duplicate the entire feature set of the others, but each app should have enough functionality to be useful in isolation. Each app has to work within different constraints. A desktop app has greater freedom in its implementation than a browser WebExtension. We’ll optimise each app to make best use of the resources available.

From there, we’ll design wireframes for each app, composing them from the list of ideal features, finding the UI/UX patterns that can be reproduced across the differing deployment environments. The goal here is not to force each app to be identical, but to come up with a common visual language, where the same feature looks familiar and behaves in a predictable way across all the apps, while the overall layout will be adapted to work best for the context. _The frame may change, but the buttons will work the same._
